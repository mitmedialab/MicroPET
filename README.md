### Abstract
Cultivation of microorganisms in space has enormous potential to enable in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), but spaceflight infrastructure for growing microorganisms without resource-intensive astronaut support is lacking. Here, we develop and validate an autonomous payload, termed the Modular Open Biological Platform (MOBP), for enzymatic reactions and microbial cultivation with fully programmable serial passaging and sample preservation. The MOBP is a compact, modular bioreactor system that allows for automatic media transfers and precise data monitoring from integrated sensors. The payload enables serial sample collection and storage for terrestrial analysis, including RNA and DNA sequencing and proteomics. We designed two experiments for validation of the MOBP aboard the International Space Station (ISS) with the application of upcycling the ubiquitous plastic poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). In the enzymatic experiment, PET is depolymerized by the enzyme PETase to terephthalate (TPA), which can then be polymerized back into virgin quality PET. In the cell-based experiment, TPA is converted to β-ketoadipate (βKA) by an engineered Pseudomonas putida KT2440 bacterium. βKA can be polymerized into a nylon-6,6 analog with improved properties for use in the production of a variety of materials, including high-performance textiles and molded parts including air intake manifolds, electro-insulation elements and hinges, thus demonstrating plastics upcycling. We posit our modular open system will enable increased realization of synthetic biology experiments and applications in spaceflight that will ultimately enable ISRU and plastics upcycling during space travel.
